# Dichotomous-Key
A dichotomous key classifier that is focused towards educational purposes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The dichotomous algorithm creates a dichotomous question model for any classification that the user wishes to construct.
It is able to prioritize its questions from the most common attribute that the majority of subjects share, to the most distinct ones which only specific species of subjects share.

The program features:
1. Flexibility towards adding/removing subjects and attributes without any limits
2. Save/Load feature that preserves and recalls dichotomous key data
3. Effective construction of the entire dichotomous key based on the list of subjects and their according attributes that the user solely entered
4. Implementation of Dichotomous search by first asking the existance of the most general trait that the majority of subjects possess, all the way to the most specific traits to classify the species of interest


The guidelines towards using the dichotomous program is as follows:

The "Subject" refers to an object that the user wants to classify.
  Ex) Specific organisms, data types, Labels of data-clusters, etc.
  
First add a subject or multiple subjects for optimal use.

The "Trait" refers to an attribute that specific "Subjects" share.
  Ex) Mammal, Carnivorous, Quadratic, Irrational, etc.
  
Add specific "Traits" before adding a trait to a subject for optimal use.

Add a Trait to a Subject to identify the certain attributes that the subject expresses

Run Dichotomous Search after all of these recommended steps are sufficed for optimal use.

* This program may contain various bugs, malfunctionalities, or discomfort on the user interface.
    Please comment or report all visible bugs or discomforts on the user interface. I will fix them as soon as possible.
